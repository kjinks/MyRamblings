<p>
<em>Welcome!</em><br>
My name is Ken Jinks, I have been creative in many pursuits over the years, drawing, 
painting, cooking, music and coding. This is my first website, it has been carefully crafted 
using, PHP, Javascript and HTML. <br>
What you will find in the gallery are a collection of my procedural artwork. All
the images are created live using code and no source images are used. Click the image to 
draw it again. I hope you enjoy.<br>
This site is best viewed with a minimum resolution of 1280x720. Your mobile device may
have trouble navigating the site.<br>
Here is a <a href="storm.html">storm</a> created with procedural techniques. You can
can witness how recursion, alpha masking, particle systems, and simplex noise can generate
an entire complex scene with only 60 kilobytes of code.<br>
You can view the source to learn how this is done. Inside of the source code I
have explained in detail how these effects are possible in your browser.<br>
Enjoy!<br>
-Ken Jinks
